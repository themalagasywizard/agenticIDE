ChatGPT a dit :

Here’s a Phase 1 PRD (Product Requirements Document) tailored for your agentic IDE project. This sets a clear scope so you can implement the UI + terminal foundation before AI or Git logic.

Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Phase 1

Product Name: Agentic IDE (codename)
Phase: 1 – Core UI Foundation
Author: [You]
Date: [Insert date]

1. Objective

Build the foundation of the IDE: a fast, lightweight desktop app with a split-pane UI (file tree, editor, terminal). The goal is to deliver a usable environment for local coding and command execution without AI or Git integrations.

This phase should establish a trustworthy developer experience: fast startup, smooth editing, and a modern terminal feel.

2. Key Features
2.1 Application Shell

Built using Tauri (Rust backend + React frontend) for performance and small binary size.

Cross-platform support: macOS, Linux, Windows.

2.2 Layout

Sidebar (Left):

File tree of the current project directory.

Expand/collapse folders.

Click to open files in editor.

Editor (Center):

Monaco Editor integration.

Syntax highlighting (TS, JS, Python, Rust).

Open multiple files in tabbed view.

Basic file save (Ctrl+S).

Terminal (Bottom):

xterm.js rendering.

Connected to OS shell via PTY (node-pty or Rust pty).

Execute commands in project directory.

Scrollback + resize support.

Multiple terminal tabs.

Top Bar (Global Navigation):

Project name / path display.

Settings button (placeholder page).

Dark/Light mode toggle.

2.3 File Management

Open local folder as workspace.

Navigate folder structure.

Create new file/folder (stub, actual FS write optional in this phase).

2.4 Terminal Features

Run standard shell commands (pwd, ls, echo hello).

Render commands and outputs as blocks (UI only, no AI yet).

Ability to clear terminal.

Support ANSI colors (xterm.js built-in).

3. Non-Goals (Phase 1)

No AI integration (OpenRouter, completions, or diffs).

No Git integration (status, commits, PRs).

No LSP or code intelligence beyond Monaco syntax highlighting.

No multi-project management.

4. UX Requirements

Performance:

App launches in <3s.

Editor input latency <50ms.

Terminal command response near real-time.

Look & Feel:

Minimal, modern UI inspired by Warp/VSCode.

Smooth transitions, consistent dark/light mode.

Tabs for files and terminals should feel natural.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

Ctrl+O – Open folder.

Ctrl+S – Save file.

Ctrl+Shift+T – New terminal tab.

Ctrl+P – File search (placeholder).

5. Technical Requirements

Frontend: React + Tailwind.

Editor: Monaco Editor.

Terminal: xterm.js + PTY integration (node-pty in Tauri/Electron).

Backend: Rust (Tauri) for filesystem + process management.

File Persistence: Direct writes to local FS.

State: Local-only (no cloud sync).

6. Success Metrics

✅ Users can open a project folder, browse files, open/edit/save code.

✅ Users can run commands in the integrated terminal.

✅ App feels snappy and stable with no noticeable lag.

✅ UI layout matches “IDE with terminal” baseline (foundation for future phases).

7. Risks & Mitigations

Risk: PTY integration issues across platforms.

Mitigation: Test node-pty on macOS/Linux/Windows early. Provide fallback shell if needed.

Risk: Monaco asset bundling in Tauri may cause size/perf issues.

Mitigation: Use local bundling, not CDN.

Risk: Scope creep (temptation to add AI early).

Mitigation: Strictly keep Phase 1 to UI + terminal + file editing.

8. Deliverables

Cross-platform desktop binary.

File tree + Monaco editor + xterm.js terminal in a 3-pane layout.

Settings page (placeholder for future OpenRouter key).

Minimal documentation:

Install & run instructions.

Shortcuts reference.
